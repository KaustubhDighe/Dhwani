# Dhwani App with Navigation
Navigation from the title fragment to other feature fragments is done and class is determined currently by a random number generator instead of the neural network.
You have to add relevant editTexts in each fragment (some I've already done). And you may also introduce a TextView to replace (using appropriate visibility parameters) the editText once the user has typed in the input. Then add appropriate intents in each fragment taking into account the editText value too.
